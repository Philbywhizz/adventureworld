Adventureworld

About
-----
Adventureworld is a computer game that was originally written by Phil Howlett and John Zaitseff in 1990-1991 on a [Microbee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroBee).

It was originally written in MicroWorld Basic on a machine with no more tha 32Kb of RAM. The game tested the limits of the memory of the machine due to all the map data.

The original Adventureworld was played with a small group of friends during lunchtime at school.  Over time a few more people at school heard about adventureworld and by the end of the year we had the whole computer room (about 16 Microbees) all downloading the game from a central 'server' via Beenet (The MicroBee's own network) and playing Adventureworld instead of people doing computing studies. It was a precious moment.

Sadly the original disk with the data has probably been lost to time (even if I had the disk I have no way of reading the data back) so the only known copy of the original source are a computer printout with hand written notes scrawled along the side for comments. The printout is also starting turn yellow and getting that old manualscript smell too.

This github repository in an attempt to bring the past into the future using modern graphics and processing power, but attempt to retain the old classic 'green screen' and beeps that the original Microbee had.
